# Tree Structure with Drag-and-Drop and Data Fetching

This project implements a tree structure where users can interact with the nodes in various ways. Features include highlighting nodes, fetching additional data for leaf nodes, and dragging and dropping nodes to reorganize the tree. The new tree structure is printed to the console after each modification.

## Features

- **Highlight Nodes**: Click on a node to highlight it and all its descendants. Click again to remove the highlight.
- **Fetch Leaf Data**: Click on a leaf node (a node without children) to fetch and display additional data from an external source.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag any node and drop it onto another node to move it and its sub-tree to the new location. The updated tree structure is printed to the console.
